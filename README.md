# one-node
One node app to rule them all.  A node app built to deploy, run, and manage other node apps and help make node cms apps like [ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.org/) more popular and easier to manage.  The overall idea is to make a cpanel like app for node. This is in the very early stages so feel free to leave suggestions or ideas/requests for features.
